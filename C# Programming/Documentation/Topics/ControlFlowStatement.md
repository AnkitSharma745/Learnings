# Control Flow Statements in C#

## 1. If-Else Statements

**Overview:**
If-else statements allow you to make decisions in code. Depending on whether a condition is true or false, different blocks of code execute.

**Syntax:**

```csharp
if (condition)
{
    // Code to execute if condition is true
}
else
{
    // Code to execute if condition is false
}
```

**Real-world Example:**
In backend development, you might use if-else to handle different request types in an API.

```csharp
if (user.IsAuthenticated)
{
    // Process authenticated request
    return Ok("User authenticated");
}
else
{
    // Handle unauthenticated request
    return Unauthorized("User not authenticated");
}
```

## 2. Switch-Case

**Overview:**
Switch-case is another control structure used for decision-making. It simplifies code when you have many conditions that evaluate to different values, especially when comparing the same variable.

**Syntax:**

```csharp
switch (expression)
{
    case value1:
        // Code for value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code for value2
        break;
    default:
        // Code if no case matches
        break;
}
```

**Real-world Example:**
Imagine a backend service that processes different types of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) based on an API call.

```csharp
switch (httpMethod)
{
    case "GET":
        return HandleGetRequest();
    case "POST":
        return HandlePostRequest();
    case "PUT":
        return HandlePutRequest();
    case "DELETE":
        return HandleDeleteRequest();
    default:
        return BadRequest("Invalid HTTP method");
}
```

## 3. Loops (For, While, Do-While)

### a) For Loop

**Overview:**
A `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It typically involves a counter.

**Syntax:**

```csharp
for (initialization; condition; increment)
{
    // Code to execute in each iteration
}
```

**Real-world Example:**
In a backend service, you may loop over a list of user requests to process them individually.

```csharp
List<string> users = GetUsers();
for (int i = 0; i < users.Count; i++)
{
    ProcessUser(users[i]);
}
```

### b) While Loop

**Overview:**
A `while` loop continues to execute as long as a condition is true.

**Syntax:**

```csharp
while (condition)
{
    // Code to execute while condition is true
}
```

**Real-world Example:**
A backend service might use a `while` loop to wait for a specific condition, such as a service becoming available.

```csharp
while (!IsServiceAvailable())
{
    // Retry connecting to the service
    RetryServiceConnection();
}
```

### c) Do-While Loop

**Overview:**
A `do-while` loop is similar to a `while` loop, but it ensures the code block executes at least once, regardless of the condition.

**Syntax:**

```csharp
do
{
    // Code to execute
}
while (condition);
```

**Real-world Example:**
You may want to send at least one request to a third-party API and then continue sending requests until a certain condition is met.

```csharp
do
{
    SendRequest();
}
while (!IsSuccessResponse());
```

## 4. Break and Continue

### a) Break

**Overview:**
The `break` statement immediately exits the nearest loop or switch-case, stopping further execution.

**Real-world Example:**
You might break out of a loop if a certain condition is met, such as finding a particular user in a list.

```csharp
foreach (var user in users)
{
    if (user == targetUser)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("User found!");
        break;
    }
}
```

### b) Continue

**Overview:**
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration.

**Real-world Example:**
Let's say you are processing multiple requests, but you want to skip any invalid requests without stopping the entire process.

```csharp
foreach (var request in requests)
{
    if (!IsValidRequest(request))
    {
        continue; // Skip this iteration if the request is invalid
    }
    ProcessRequest(request);
}
```

## Conclusion:

Each of these control flow mechanisms is crucial in backend development, helping you manage decision-making, repetitive tasks, and breaking or continuing flows when necessary. Whether youâ€™re handling authentication, processing requests, or interacting with databases, mastering these control statements is key to writing efficient and clean backend code in C#.
