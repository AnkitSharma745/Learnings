## What is material ui ?
Material UI (MUI) is a popular React UI framework that implements Google's Material Design guidelines. It provides a wide range of pre-built components like buttons, modals, cards, and more, which are customizable and designed for responsiveness, accessibility, and performance. MUI helps you build beautiful and professional-looking UIs quickly with less custom CSS or JS.

### Why use material UI ?

- Pre-built Components: It provides a rich set of ready-to-use components, saving time in UI development.
- Customization: MUI is highly customizable, allowing you to style components to match your design requirements using Themes and Styled Components.
- Responsiveness: MUI components are responsive by default, allowing your app to work well on different screen sizes.
- Figma Integration: MUI has design resources for Figma, which makes it easy to follow the design closely when converting it to code.
- Community Support: With a large community, it's well-documented and constantly updated.

### Benefits of using material ui ?
- Faster Development: With pre-built, customizable components, MUI speeds up the frontend development process.
- Consistency: It ensures design consistency by adhering to Material Design guidelines.
- Customization: You can create your own themes, adjust colors, typography, or override styles, making it adaptable to any design system.
- Responsive and Accessible: Components are built with mobile-first design and accessibility in mind.
- Integration: MUI integrates well with other React libraries and frameworks like Redux, React Router, and Formik.
### Draw backs of using material ui ?

- Learning Curve: If you’re used to regular HTML/CSS or basic JSX, understanding MUI’s theming and component structure can be a bit challenging initially.
- Performance: For very large applications with many customizations, performance can sometimes become an issue due to the size of the library.
- Style Overriding: Overriding default styles can sometimes be tricky if you’re not familiar with MUI’s CSS-in-JS styling approach.
- Bundle Size: MUI can increase your app’s bundle size, which may require optimization steps like tree shaking to avoid unused code.


### Can We Write Normal JSX and Material UI Together?

Yes, you can use normal JSX (HTML/CSS) and Material UI components together. MUI is built on React, so it doesn't interfere with standard JSX components. You can easily mix and match regular HTML, custom components, and Material UI components in the same codebase.

For example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@mui/material';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Normal JSX Component</h1>
      <button>Normal HTML Button</button>
      <Button variant="contained">Material UI Button</Button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### Errors You May Encounter When Using Material UI in Normal JSX Code

#### Style Conflicts:
If you're using regular CSS styles and Material UI together, you may encounter conflicts due to how MUI uses **CSS-in-JS**. Material UI uses **emotion** or **styled-components** for styling, which can sometimes override or conflict with regular CSS rules.

**Example:**

```jsx
<Button className="myButton">MUI Button</Button>
```

### Let's see how to work with Material UI--------

#### HTML code 
```html

<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```
In Material UI, you'd use components like <AppBar>, <Toolbar>, and <Button> to achieve the same thing but with pre-built Material styles.

```javascript

import React from 'react';
import AppBar from '@mui/material/AppBar';
import Toolbar from '@mui/material/Toolbar';
import Typography from '@mui/material/Typography';
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';
import Box from '@mui/material/Box';

function Navbar() {
  return (
    <AppBar position="static">
      <Toolbar>
        <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
          My Website
        </Typography>
        <Button color="inherit">Home</Button>
        <Button color="inherit">About</Button>
        <Button color="inherit">Contact</Button>
      </Toolbar>
    </AppBar>
  );
}

export default Navbar;

```
